This is the main repository for my "first" solo project, as instructed by ToP

This will be where I really start making proper customisations using creativity, and what I've learnt during this course (and previously).

I plan to come back and add functionality using more advanced CSS and JavaScript, but my initial commits will be focussed on structural design using Flex.
